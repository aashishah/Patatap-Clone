# Patatap-Clone
This is a clone of the popular site Patatap, developed as a part of the Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele. 
Press any key from a-z to hear a wide range of sounds accompanied by an animation. 
The project was built using functions from Paper.js and Howler.js, which are open source libraries. 
The sounds that are used were obtained from the following git repo: https://github.com/jonobr1/Neuronal-Synchrony, which is free to use under the MIT license.
